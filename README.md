This is my first time using Backend and Frontend Techniques to build a website.

We use the languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python Flask.
- Build Backend API endpoint on: Heroku
- Build Frontend website on: Google Cloud Platform(GCP)

Here is the DEMO video of the website in Mandarin: https://youtu.be/8rgD05Q27zQ
